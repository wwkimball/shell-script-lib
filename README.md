# Standard Shell Script Library

This project establishes a standard library of Bash shell script functions and
generally-useful helper tools.  This is a living standard, meaning that its
author and maintainer(s) will grow it over time and adapt it to changes in shell
script interpreters.  As such, be sure you pin your submodule import to a
specific release and update your submodule pins only as needed and with adequate
testing.
